# Assignment 2
For this assignment, you are going to create a new web page to add to an existing website in my GitHub account. To do this, you will clone my repository, create a branch for your changes, and then create a pull request to merge your changes back to my public repo.

## Instructions
1. Fork this repository by clicking the "Fork" button in GitHub. This will create a copy of this repository with its complete history as a new repository in your account.
2. Clone the repository to your computer. Do this by clicking the green "Code" button in the repository, select "SSH", and copy the URL that will look something like this: `git@github.com:my-username/repository.git`. Once you have that URL copied, open the Git Bash terminal in your `Projects` folder. Once open, run the "git clone" command with the copied git URL:
`git clone <paste your copied repository here>`
3. Open VSCode. Select `File` -> `Open Folder` and open the `Assignment2` folder which should have been created when step 2 is complete.
4. Create a branch for your changes. Do this by clicking on the `Main` branch name in the bottom left corner of VSCode. This will open VSCode's `Command Palette` at the top center of the program. Here you will see an option to `Create new branch\`. Select that and type a unique branch name so that we don't end up with conflicts for this exercise. An easy thing to do here would be to include your username in the branch name. For example, I might name mine `hayatae-new-page`. The branch name can not contain spaces. Once you've selected a name, hit the enter key. This will create the branch for you and make it your active branch which you can see in the bottom left corner of VSCode.
5. Create a new html page! Again, to avoid conflicts for this exercise, name the page something that includes your user name. In a more practical example, we'd all be creating different pages for different topics, but I'm not coordinated enough to organize that at the moment. :D So create something like `gale-page.html`. Here, feel free to add any content you'd like.
6. Edit the existing `index.html` page and add a link to your new page!
7. Save all files and try it out by opening the `index.html` page in your browser. You should be able to click your link to go to your page. You could also add a link on your page to go back to the home page like `gale-page.html` has.
8. Commit your changes to your branch and push the changes. Don't forget to write a good commit message!
9. Go back to the original repository on GitHub in hayatae's account and click on the `Pull requests` tab: `https://github.com/hayatae/Assignment2/pulls`
10. Follow the prompts on screen to create a new pull request from your branch in your fork of the repository to my main repository.
