# Assignment 2
## Instructions
1. Fork this repository by clicking the "Fork" button in GitHub. This will create a copy of this repository with its complete history as a new repository in your account.
2. Clone the repository to your computer. Do this by clicking the green "Code" button in the repository, select "SSH", and copy the URL that will look something like this: `git@github.com:my-username/repository.git`. Once you have that URL copied, open the Git Bash terminal in your `Projects` folder. Once open, run the "git clone" command with the copied git URL:
`git clone <paste your copied repository here>`
3. Open VSCode. Select `File` -> `Open Folder` and open the `Assignment2` folder which should have been created when step 2 is complete.
4. Create a branch for your changes.
